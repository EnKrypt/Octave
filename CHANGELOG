Changelog started 13/09/2012

Format:
Head each day with dd/mm/yyyy
As you program, each minor change you make should have a bullet created in the changelog.
When you're finished programming, append a todo list consisting of the things the next programmer should do, including suggested features (if relevant).

The log and todo list should be separated by an empty line, and all bullets should have 2*level+1 spaces preceding it, where level is the bullet level starting at 0. Bullets should alternate between * and - with each level.

The todo list should be ordered by priority.

13/09/2012
 * Created a playground by enclosing an area with walls
 * Added a solid attribute to MapEntity
 * Added tree and rock solid entities to the playground
 * Added Tile class
 * Added a rug tile to the playground
 * Added a hello world tile to the playground (prints Hello World when you step on it)
 * Made Character solid
 * Removed drawing in scaleImage()

TODO:
 * Create a map editor (this should be very high priority)
   - Snap grids
     * Objects placed should snap to the nearest intersection of the grid
	 * Objects should snap by their collision mask
	 * Grids' cell global widths and heights should be adjustable (aka a 16x16 pixel/cell grid should be able to become a 32x32 pixel/cell grid)
     * Cartesian (standard up-down left-right)
	 * Isometric (diagonal, lines with slopes of 1/2 and -1/2)
	 * Unordered (no snap grid)
   - Object library
     * Library of preloaded object/tile definitions (objects and tiles may have separate libraries)
   - Ability to delete objects already placed
   - Ability to manually adjust some attributes of individual objects (e.g. x and y values)
   - Export to a file (programming routines to read from the file should come later)
 * Map loading routine
 * Fix the sprite-sliding glitch (walking in any direction for a second stops the animation, making the sprite look like it's sliding)
 * Fix the pausing of the convobox
